Evaluating Fairness in AI-Generated Housing Agreements
- SPI352 Final Project -


This paper evaluates AI-generated rental pricing for potential bias against FHA-protected categories such as ethnicity, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. Using FHA-bias scores across property types (affordable, median, high-end), models are audited using this framework. In this particular example, gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4o were compared. There seems to be improvement in the overall variability of price generation, perhaps indicating bias preventive measures being implemented in later iterations of gpt.
